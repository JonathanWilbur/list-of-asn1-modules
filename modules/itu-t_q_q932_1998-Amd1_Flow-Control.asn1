-- When the receiverReady coding is sent in FACILITY message, the 
-- maximumNumberOfMessages and timerT data elements may optionally
-- be included. The MaximumNumberOfMessages is an integer that specifies
-- the number of messages that may be sent in the time interval specifed by 
-- timerT for the call reference identified in the FACILITY message and these 
-- may optionally be included when the receiverReady coding is sent. The 
-- replenishmentParameter indicates the number of additional messages that
-- may be sent at the end of timer interval timerT.
}

-- This operation is a Class 5 operation
